# CMP-07 - Judgment Service Component Specification

## 1. Document control

- **Version:** 1.0
- **Status:** Final
- **Effective date:** 2026-07-27
- **Component ID:** CMP-07
- **Authority:** Subordinate to Books I, II, and III; semantically aligned to Book X
- **Machine contracts:** Book IX responsibility

## 2. Purpose and scope

Produce evidence-linked Decision Objects that expose alternatives, uncertainty, values, authority context, rationale, and review conditions.

## 3. Constitutional and architectural basis

- Book I: Decisions 8-23, 30-37, 40-43, 47-50, and 58.
- Book II: Chapters 09.
- Book III: Chapters 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9; Chapter 2 for repository, dependency, configuration, and secret controls.
- Book X terms: HAL, Identity, Authority, Evidence Object, Verification, Conformance, Judgment, Decision Object, Uncertainty.

## 4. Responsibilities

- Own and protect mutation of Decision Objects.
- Own and protect mutation of alternative evaluations.
- Own and protect mutation of uncertainty assessments.
- Own and protect mutation of review conditions.
- Enforce versioned logical contracts and produce attributable decisions.
- Preserve identity, authority, provenance, evidence, and lifecycle continuity.
- Contain dependency and internal failure without silently weakening higher-order requirements.

## 5. Explicit non-responsibilities

- MUST NOT own or independently redefine Intent.
- MUST NOT own or independently redefine authority grants.
- MUST NOT own or independently redefine evidence custody.
- MUST NOT own or independently redefine action execution.
- MUST NOT create Authority because it stores data, runs code, possesses credentials, or provides a useful capability.
- MUST NOT define Book IX wire formats, transports, generated client bindings, or protocol-specific error codes.

## 6. Authoritative and derived state

| State class | Records | Mutation rule |
|---|---|---|
| Authoritative | Decision Objects, alternative evaluations, uncertainty assessments, review conditions | Only CMP-07 may mutate; every mutation is versioned and evidenced. |
| Explicitly non-owned | Intent, authority grants, evidence custody, action execution | Read only through owning-component interfaces; no shadow authority. |
| Derived | caches, indexes, projections, replicas, dashboards | Rebuildable, provenance-linked, non-authoritative, and never a bypass path. |

## 7. Logical interfaces

| ID | Kind | Logical operation | Required semantic outcome | Book IX handoff |

## 8. Commands, queries, events, and schema requirements

Commands: Request Judgment, Record Decision, Reconsider Decision, Withdraw Decision. Queries: Get Decision Object, Explain Rationale, List Alternatives. Events: Decision Recorded, Decision Reconsidered, Decision Withdrawn.

Commands MAY request mutation but MUST NOT state that a fact has occurred before authoritative commit. Queries MUST NOT intentionally mutate authoritative state. Events MUST describe completed facts and MUST be immutable. All schemas MUST carry stable semantic identifiers, version, identity, authority context where applicable, correlation, causation, idempotency, time/freshness, provenance, classification, and explicit error/result semantics. Book IX will define their machine representation.

## 9. Lifecycle and state machines

Declared lifecycle: **Proposed > Deliberating > Decided > Under Review > Superseded or Closed**.

Every transition requires an expected prior state and version, authenticated initiator, current authority and policy context where applicable, transition guard, idempotency key, timestamp with declared time semantics, and immutable transition evidence. Terminal states MUST reject further mutation except through an explicitly governed reactivation or recovery transition.

## 10. Identity, authority, and policy checks

Every command MUST resolve a durable caller Identity, authenticate the current context, evaluate effective Authority and Permission, verify delegation scope and expiry where used, enforce applicable policy and operating mode, and bind the decision to the exact requested effect. Trust, role, network location, credential possession, conversation, historical approval, or capability availability MUST NOT substitute for Authority.

## 11. Trust boundaries

All callers, dependencies, operators, infrastructure, providers, replicas, and recovery inputs remain outside the component's semantic trust boundary. Co-process or same-host deployment does not remove identity, integrity, freshness, Authority, Permission, provenance, or replay checks. Cross-domain exchange MUST traverse the Constitutional Firewall under an active Treaty.

## 12. Security controls

The component MUST apply least privilege, authenticated and integrity-protected communication, input and output validation, replay resistance, defaults that deny protected effects when prerequisites are absent, secret indirection, dependency provenance, signed build and release evidence, tamper-evident audit, and explicit failure decisions naming the protected value, hazard, containment, and residual risk. Compromised callers and dependencies MUST be assumed possible.

## 13. Privacy controls

The component MUST classify handled data; verify authorized purpose; minimize collection, processing, retention, logging, and disclosure; enforce access and deletion obligations; evaluate inference risk; and preserve evidence of privacy decisions. Sensitive payloads MUST NOT be copied into errors, metrics, traces, or ordinary Audit Records.

## 14. Failure modes and containment

Material failure modes: missing alternative, hidden uncertainty, authority laundering, stale evidence, irreproducible rationale. Each MUST have detection criteria, bounded blast radius, declared degraded behavior, evidence preservation, notification, and an exit condition. Unsafe mutation MUST stop when required identity, authority, policy, state, evidence, time, or verification context is unavailable.

## 15. Recovery behavior

Recovery MUST select an authorized recovery point, verify identity and lineage, reconcile authoritative versions and partitions, validate provenance and integrity, re-establish dependencies, replay or compensate truthfully, and prove post-recovery invariants before admitting mutation. Recovery MUST preserve required evidence and MUST NOT erase unresolved divergence.

## 16. Observability and required evidence

Required evidence includes command admission and denial, policy and authority decision references, state version and transition records, dependency health, security and privacy decisions, failure containment, recovery, migration, and conformance results. Logs, metrics, and traces MUST use structured schemas, correlation and causation, redaction, classification, retention, integrity, and clock-quality metadata.

## 17. Performance and resource requirements

The component owner MUST define evidence-backed latency, throughput, concurrency, queue, storage, freshness, and recovery objectives before qualification for the declared live-effect environment and approved Reality Boundary stage. Resource pressure MUST trigger bounded admission, backpressure, degradation, or rejection and MUST NOT bypass authority, evidence, privacy, audit, ordering, or state-integrity requirements.

## 18. Deployment model and topology flexibility

Book II permits implementation and topology flexibility only where identity, ownership, consistency, trust boundaries, failure containment, recovery, and observability invariants remain true. Replication improves resilience but does not create a second semantic owner or independent Authority. Every topology requires tested partition, upgrade, restore, and secret-rotation behavior.

## 19. Dependencies

- Intent Service: consume only through its governed logical interface; validate version, identity, integrity, availability, and failure semantics.
- Knowledge Service: consume only through its governed logical interface; validate version, identity, integrity, availability, and failure semantics.
- Evidence Service: consume only through its governed logical interface; validate version, identity, integrity, availability, and failure semantics.
- Authority and Delegation Service: consume only through its governed logical interface; validate version, identity, integrity, availability, and failure semantics.
- Outcome and Success Evaluation Service: consume only through its governed logical interface; validate version, identity, integrity, availability, and failure semantics.

## 20. Compatibility, versioning, and migration

Public and internal logical contracts, state schemas, policies, events, and evidence formats MUST be versioned. Backward and forward compatibility MUST be declared and tested. Migration requires an Architecture Decision Record when consequential, compatibility analysis, dual-read/write only when bounded and verified, recoverable checkpoints, signed artifacts, staged qualification, and post-migration reconciliation.

## 21. Conformance tests

| Test ID | Test | Method | Expected evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| CMP-07-TST-001 | Sole-owner mutation | Attempt mutation through a consumer, replica, cache, operator path, and direct datastore route. | Every unauthorized path is denied and evidenced. |
| CMP-07-TST-002 | Authority denial | Invoke every command with absent, expired, revoked, mismatched, and over-broad authority context. | No state changes; denial reason and evidence are complete. |
| CMP-07-TST-003 | Valid lifecycle | Exercise every declared transition with valid guards and fresh versions. | One transition Evidence Object is admitted per transition identifier; duplicate attempts produce no additional state mutation or admitted Evidence Object. |
| CMP-07-TST-004 | Invalid lifecycle | Attempt skipped, stale, replayed, and terminal-state transitions. | Every invalid transition is rejected without partial mutation. |
| CMP-07-TST-005 | Critical invariant | A Decision Object records judgment but does not itself create Permission, Authority, or a real-world effect. | Invariant holds under normal, concurrent, degraded, and recovery conditions. |
| CMP-07-TST-006 | Failure containment | Inject missing alternative, hidden uncertainty, authority laundering, stale evidence, irreproducible rationale. | Unsafe work stops, evidence is preserved, and declared containment state is observable. |
| CMP-07-TST-007 | Recovery | Restore from a verified checkpoint, reconcile dependencies, and resume after validation. | Identity, state, authority, provenance, and evidence continuity are proven. |
| CMP-07-TST-008 | Contract compatibility | Run current and prior supported contract versions plus an unsupported version. | Supported behavior remains compatible; unsupported input fails explicitly. |
| CMP-07-TST-009 | Privacy and security | Inject secrets, personal data, malicious input, confused-deputy requests, and log-exfiltration probes. | Least privilege and data controls hold; prohibited data is absent from telemetry. |
| CMP-07-TST-010 | Topology independence | Repeat critical tests under permitted single-node, replicated, partitioned, and restored topologies. | Topology does not multiply authority or mutation ownership. |

## 22. Prohibited shortcuts

- Direct mutation of authoritative storage outside the component.
- Treating a cache, replica, projection, search index, log, or dashboard as authoritative.
- Inferring Authority from identity, role, trust, credentials, location, usefulness, or past approval.
- Failing open because a dependency, verification step, policy service, audit path, Authority source, or Permission decision is unavailable.
- Publishing an Event before authoritative commit or treating a command receipt as a completed fact.
- Using rollback language for an irreversible effect that requires Compensation.
- Embedding Book IX wire-level choices as independent architecture.
